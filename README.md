# Gas-Price-Comparison-Calculator

This program's intention is to allow the user to compare the price of gasoline/diesel in their current city with a city that is of some distance.
The program will then compute the profit/loss of traveling to the other city to refill their gas. The program accounts for gasoline used for travel.
